    "The idea behind Reinforcement Learning is that an agent will learn from the environment by interacting with it through trial and error and receiving rewards, negative or positive, as feedback for performing actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine putting your little sister in front of a slightly modified version of Trackmania where crossing a checkpoint or the finish line gives you one point but falling in the water substracts one point. You put a controller in her hands and let her alone.\n",

    "## Rewards and the discounting\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward is fundamental in RL because it’s the only feedback the agent gets. It enables the agent to know if the action taken was good or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cumulative reward at each time step t can be written as:\n",

    "\n",
    "You could sum all the reward you expect to get in the future until the end of the run. However, in practice, the rewards that come sooner are more likely to happen since they are more predictable than the long-term future reward. That is why we introduce a discount rate for future potential rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say your agent is at the start of the following track. Your goal is to cross the maximum number of checkpoints before falling off the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"discount_track.png\" style=\"border-radius:10px; width:100%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It's more probable to cross the checkpoints near your position than the ones close to the finish. The farther a checkpoint is from your position, the more likely it is to fall off before getting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the reward given for crossing a checkpoint far away is discounted more. We are not sure we'll be able to cross the far away checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, to discount the rewards, we proceed like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We define a discount rate called gamma. It must be between 0 and 1. Most of the time between 0.99 and 0.90.\n",
    "- The larger the gamma, the smaller the discount. This means our agent cares more about the long-term reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, the smaller the gamma, the bigger the discount. This means our agent cares more about the short term reward (the nearest checkpoints here).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, each reward will be discounted by gamma to the exponent of the time step. As the time step increases, the car will have more opportunities to fall off, so the future reward is less and less likely to happen.\n",

    "## Exploration/Exploitation tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at how to solve Reinforcement Learning problems, we must cover a very important topic: the exploration/exploitation trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploration is exploring the environment by trying random actions in order to find more information about the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploitation is exploiting known information to maximize the reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal of our RL agent is to maximize the expected cumulative reward. However, we can fall into a common trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"exploration_track.png\" style=\"border-radius:10px; width:100%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our RL agent is rewarded for reaching the finish line fast. The faster it cross the finish line, the more reward it gets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider that our RL agent learnt that going forward in a straight line is a good way to reach its destination if there is no obstacle in between. The agent will always take the road on the left and never try the road on the right even if the right road is actually faster (exploitation).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if our agent does a little bit of exploration and try the road on the right, it will discover a faster route that yields a bigger reward (exploration).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we call the exploration/exploitation trade-off. We need to balance how much we explore the environment and how much we exploit what we know about the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we must define a rule that helps to handle this trade-off. We’ll see in future post how PedroAI handles this trade-off."
